# **Buying Property in Mexico City: A Comprehensive Guide for American Expats**

Mexico City, a vibrant metropolis rich in culture and history, has increasingly become an attractive destination for American citizens seeking new opportunities and lifestyles.1 For those considering a move or seeking an investment, the prospect of purchasing a home or apartment in this dynamic urban center often arises. This report serves as a comprehensive guide for an American expat who has recently arrived in Mexico City and is contemplating the purchase of property, whether for personal residency or potential use as a short-term rental through platforms like Airbnb. It aims to clarify the regulations governing foreign property ownership, highlight the key differences in the buying process compared to the United States, explain the rules and permits necessary for property renovation, detail the restrictions and obligations associated with operating an Airbnb, provide resources for finding and vetting architects, identify the essential paperwork required for property acquisition, and outline the property tax system in Mexico City.

## **Understanding Foreign Ownership Regulations in Mexico City**

Foreign individuals, including American citizens, possess the legal right to acquire real estate in Mexico.2 This right is enshrined within the framework of the Mexican Constitution, specifically Article 27, which, while establishing national ownership over land and water, empowers the state to grant ownership rights to foreigners under certain stipulations.7 This foundational principle assures prospective American buyers that their aspirations of owning property in Mexico City are indeed achievable.

A crucial aspect of Mexican property law that often concerns foreign buyers is the concept of the "Restricted Zone." This zone encompasses land within 100 kilometers (approximately 62 miles) of Mexico's international borders and 50 kilometers (approximately 31 miles) from its coastlines.2 Within these designated areas, direct ownership of land by foreign individuals is generally prohibited.2 However, it is vital to note that Mexico City is geographically situated inland and is significantly distant from both the US border and the coastlines, placing it firmly outside the boundaries of the Restricted Zone.2 This geographical distinction has significant implications for the process of property acquisition.

Because Mexico City lies outside the Restricted Zone, American citizens can directly own property within the city, with the title to the real estate registered directly in their name, mirroring the ownership rights afforded to Mexican citizens.2 This direct ownership pathway simplifies the acquisition process considerably, eliminating the need for more intricate legal mechanisms typically required in the Restricted Zone.

In contrast, for properties located within the Restricted Zone, Mexican law provides a mechanism known as the "fideicomiso," or bank trust. This legal arrangement allows foreign buyers to obtain beneficial rights to property even though the legal title is held by a Mexican bank.2 Under a fideicomiso, the foreign buyer possesses all the rights of ownership, including the ability to use, lease, sell, and bequeath the property, while the bank acts as the trustee.2 Fideicomisos typically have a term of 50 years and are renewable, but they involve setup and annual maintenance fees.4 While this system is crucial for coastal and border areas, it is generally not applicable to property purchases in Mexico City.

Regardless of the property's location in Mexico, including in a city outside the Restricted Zone like Mexico City, foreign buyers are required to obtain a permit from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Secretaría de Relaciones Exteriores \- SRE) to legally register their property deed.7 The primary purpose of this SRE permit is to ensure that foreign property owners are treated on an equal footing with Mexican citizens in all matters related to their real estate transactions.9 A key component of the SRE permit is the "Cláusula Calvo," a legal agreement wherein the foreign buyer explicitly agrees to abide by Mexican laws and regulations concerning their property and, crucially, waives the right to seek diplomatic intervention from their home country in the event of any property-related disputes.6 Obtaining the SRE permit typically involves a specific fee.9 This permit and the associated Calvo Clause are fundamental legal requirements for any foreigner acquiring property in Mexico.

## **Mexico City vs. the USA: Key Differences in the Property Buying Process**

While the ultimate goal of purchasing property is universal, the legal and regulatory pathways to achieving this in Mexico City differ in several significant ways from those in the United States.17 Understanding these distinctions is crucial for a smooth and successful transaction. It is also important to note that real estate regulations in Mexico can vary from state to state, adding another layer of complexity.12

A central figure in Mexican real estate transactions is the "Notario Público." Unlike their counterparts in the US, whose primary role is to authenticate signatures, the Notario in Mexico is a highly qualified legal professional, essentially a quasi-governmental official appointed by the state governor.8 To become a Notario, individuals must possess a law degree, have extensive legal experience, and pass rigorous examinations.20 The Notario's responsibilities are far-reaching, including conducting thorough due diligence on the property, verifying the legality of the transaction, ensuring all necessary permits are in order (including those for foreign buyers), drafting the official property deed ("escritura pública"), overseeing the signing process, and ensuring the deed is properly registered with the Public Registry of Property.12 Furthermore, the Notario is often responsible for calculating and withholding certain taxes associated with the sale.12 As a buyer, you have the right to choose the Notario Público to handle your transaction.12 This comprehensive role of the Notario provides a significant level of legal oversight and assurance that is generally not found in the US system.

Financing the purchase of property in Mexico City as an American may also differ from the US experience. While it is possible for foreigners to obtain mortgage loans from Mexican banks, the process and terms can vary.3 Interest rates on mortgages in Mexico tend to be higher than in the US, and foreign buyers might face slightly elevated rates.8 Lenders may also require a larger down payment, often around 30% of the property's value.6 It is worth noting that a significant number of real estate transactions in Mexico, particularly those involving foreign buyers, are conducted on a cash basis.17 While exploring financing options through US lenders or considering seller financing might be possibilities, these avenues could also come with higher interest rates.6 The financing landscape in Mexico for foreign buyers generally presents more stringent requirements and potentially higher costs compared to the US.

The use of escrow accounts in Mexico provides a secure mechanism for managing funds during a real estate transaction. A neutral third-party escrow company holds the buyer's funds until all the conditions of the sale agreement have been fulfilled, providing security for both parties.27 While the Notario acts as a crucial legal intermediary, they typically do not function as an escrow agent. Dedicated escrow companies specialize in this financial aspect of the transaction.20 Another important consideration is title insurance. In Mexico, unlike in some parts of the US, there is no state guarantee of property title. Therefore, obtaining title insurance is highly recommended, especially for foreign buyers.8 Title insurance provides financial protection against potential title defects, undisclosed liens, or future disputes over ownership.8

The timeline for completing a property purchase in Mexico City can sometimes be longer than in the US due to the thorough legal processes involved and the due diligence conducted by the Notario.22 Buyers should also be aware of the associated transaction costs. Closing costs for the buyer in Mexico typically range from 3.5% to 7.5% of the property's final price. These costs include the property transfer tax (also known as acquisition tax), notary fees, and legal fees.8 Additional costs may include the fee for obtaining the mandatory SRE permit.8 On a more positive note, annual property taxes in Mexico are generally significantly lower than in the United States.3

**Table 1: Comparison of Typical Property Buying Costs: Mexico City vs. USA**

| Cost Category | Typical Range in Mexico City | Typical Range in USA |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Property Transfer/Acquisition Tax | 2.00% \- 5.00% 8 | Varies by State |
| Notary Fees | 0.50% \- 1.50% 8 | Varies by State |
| Legal Fees | 1.00% \- 1.50% 8 | Varies by State |
| Real Estate Agent Fee (Buyer) | Optional | Varies by State |
| Real Estate Agent Fee (Seller) | 3.00% \- 6.00% 8 | Varies by State |
| Title Insurance | Recommended | Common |
| Escrow Fees | Varies | Common |

## **Navigating Property Renovation in Mexico City**

If you are considering renovating a property in Mexico City, it is essential to understand the local regulations and permit requirements. Generally, building permits are necessary for any new construction or significant remodeling work.44 The enforcement of building safety standards is the responsibility of the local jurisdiction, and Mexico City often serves as a benchmark for regulations across the country.47 The Secretaría de Desarrollo Urbano y Vivienda (SEDUVI) is the primary agency in Mexico City overseeing urban development and the issuance of building permits.48

Obtaining a renovation permit typically involves submitting detailed architectural plans and undergoing inspections by the authorities.50 Common documents required for a residential renovation permit application include the property title ("escrituras"), the property owner's official photo identification, a signed application form (available from SEDUVI), proof of recent property tax payments, and a comprehensive set of blueprints that have been signed by a licensed architect.48 The specific complexity and requirements of the permit process can vary depending on the scope and nature of the planned renovations.46

It is highly advisable to work with reputable and legally established building companies and architects for any renovation projects.51 Having a clear and legally binding written contract that outlines the full scope of the work, the total project cost, and the agreed-upon timeline is crucial.51 You should also insist on receiving "facturas" (official legal receipts) for all payments made for services and materials.51 Another key figure in the construction process in Mexico is the "Director Responsable de Obra" (DRO), a licensed architect or engineer who is legally responsible for ensuring that the project adheres to all applicable building regulations and safety standards.48

SEDUVI plays a central role in enforcing building codes and issuing permits in Mexico City.48 The Mexico City Building Code itself serves as a model for construction standards in many other regions of the country.47 It is prudent to research the specific local construction regulations that apply to your property and the intended renovations. This information can often be found online by searching for terms like "reglamento construcción" combined with "Ciudad de México".48 Familiarizing yourself with SEDUVI's requirements and the local building codes is essential to ensure that your renovation plans are fully compliant with the law.

## **Operating an Airbnb in Mexico City: Rules and Restrictions**

Mexico City has established a regulatory framework governing short-term rentals offered through online platforms like Airbnb.53 These regulations are designed to balance the benefits of tourism with the needs of local residents and address concerns about rising housing costs.55 It is important to be aware that the rules surrounding short-term rentals in Mexico City are subject to change.54

Operating an Airbnb legally in Mexico City requires hosts to register their properties with the city's Registry of Technological Platforms (Registro de Plataformas Digitales de Hospedaje).53 This registration is typically valid for two years and must be renewed.53 Each property listed for short-term rental must be registered separately and will receive a unique registration number that must be displayed on all online listings.53 Obtaining an operating license is also mandatory and is often integrated into the host registration process.53 Required documents for registration typically include official identification, proof of address, proof of property ownership, a safety compliance declaration, and civil liability insurance.53 Hosts with more than three properties may face additional requirements, such as obtaining a merchant establishment key and an operating permit.53

Current regulations in Mexico City limit short-term rentals to a maximum of 180 nights per year.54 There is also the potential for a 50% annual occupancy limit.53 Additionally, properties classified as government-built social housing are typically prohibited from being used as short-term rentals.58 It is crucial to verify the specific zoning laws for your property to ensure that short-term rentals are permitted in your chosen location.53

Airbnb hosts in Mexico City are subject to various tax obligations. These include the federal Income Tax (ISR) and Value-Added Tax (VAT) at a rate of 16% on rental income.53 There is also a local Lodging Services Tax (Occupancy Tax) in Mexico City, which ranges from 3% to 5% of the total listing price.53 While platforms like Airbnb may collect and remit VAT and the Lodging Services Tax, hosts are responsible for reporting their income and paying the applicable Income Tax.53 Obtaining a Mexican Tax Identification Number (RFC) is essential for fulfilling these obligations.5 Consulting with a local accountant who specializes in short-term rental income is highly recommended to ensure full compliance with all tax regulations.55

## **Finding and Vetting Architects in Mexico City**

Locating qualified architects in Mexico City can be achieved through various resources. Online directories such as Clutch.co 69 and e-architect.com 70 provide listings of architectural firms and professionals in the area. The Colegio de Arquitectos de la Ciudad de México is the primary professional organization for architects in the city, and their member directory can be a valuable resource.52 Freelance platforms like Upwork 77 also offer a pool of architectural designers. Seeking recommendations from your real estate agent or other expatriates living in Mexico City can also be a fruitful approach.21

While a national licensing system for architects might not be strictly enforced throughout Mexico, it is crucial to ensure that any architect you hire in Mexico City is qualified and possesses the necessary local credentials.4 Building regulations in Mexico City are the responsibility of the City Administration.47 Inquire about the architect's professional license or registration number ("cédula profesional") and request to see a copy for verification.46 Be aware of the role of "peritos arquitectos" or "directores responsables de obras (DROs)," licensed architects who are authorized to sign off on building plans and take responsibility for regulatory compliance.48 US architectural licenses are generally not recognized in Mexico, so focusing on locally recognized credentials is essential.80 While the Colegio de Arquitectos de la Ciudad de México does not directly handle licensing, membership in such an organization often signifies a commitment to professional standards and can be a good indicator of an architect's qualifications.81

## **Essential Paperwork and Legal Documents for Property Purchase**

Purchasing property in Mexico City requires specific documentation from the buyer. This typically includes a valid passport and, if intending to reside in Mexico, a valid Mexican visa.2 You will also need to provide proof of your current address 2 and obtain a Mexican Tax Identification Number (RFC).5 Proof of your financial solvency to complete the purchase will also be necessary.2 Furthermore, you must obtain the SRE permit from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.7

The "Contrato de Compraventa," or purchase agreement, is a legally binding document outlining all the terms and conditions of the property sale.2 It is crucial to have this agreement thoroughly reviewed by a Mexican attorney specializing in real estate law and to ensure it is available in both Spanish and English for clarity.84 An initial "promesa de compraventa," or promissory agreement, may be used to formalize the initial offer.19

Conducting thorough due diligence is paramount. This includes a comprehensive title search ("Búsqueda de Títulos de Propiedad") to verify the seller's legal ownership and identify any liens or encumbrances.2 Engaging a Mexican real estate attorney is highly recommended for this process.2 The Notario Público will also perform a title search as part of their responsibilities.12 Exercise caution regarding properties with a history of "ejido" (communal) land ownership and ensure the property has a clear, private freehold title.2

The Notario Público plays a vital role in finalizing the paperwork. They are responsible for preparing and certifying all necessary legal documents, including the final property deed ("escritura pública").2 The Notario also ensures the proper registration of the property title in your name with the Public Registry of Property.2

## **Understanding Property Taxes in Mexico City**

The annual property tax in Mexico City is called "Predial".18 It is calculated based on the property's "cadastral value," an assessed value determined by the Mexico City authorities, which is generally lower than the market value.2 The Predial tax is calculated using the formula: Cadastral Value × Tax Rate \= Annual Property Tax. The tax rate in Mexico City typically ranges from 0.1% to 0.4% of the cadastral value, but it is advisable to confirm the specific rate with the local tax authorities.2 Payments are usually due annually, often with discounts offered for early payment in January or February.42 You can typically pay the Predial tax online through the official Mexico City government portal, in person at designated tax offices, or at authorized banks.42

Other relevant taxes include the Property Acquisition Tax ("Impuesto sobre Adquisición de Inmuebles" \- ISAI), a one-time tax paid by the buyer at the time of purchase, which is approximately 5% of the property's purchase price in Mexico City.2 The Capital Gains Tax ("Impuesto sobre la Renta" \- ISR) is levied on the profit from the sale of property and is typically paid by the seller.2 If you plan to rent out your property, any rental income will also be subject to income tax in Mexico.2

The annual deadline for paying the Predial tax in Mexico City is usually by the end of February.42 Check the official Mexico City municipality website for online payment options and exact deadlines.89 It is your responsibility to ensure timely payment, as tax bills may not always be sent.42

**Table 2: Summary of Property Taxes and Fees for Buyers in Mexico City**

| Tax/Fee Category | Description | Estimated Rate/Cost | Who Pays |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Predial | Annual property tax based on cadastral value | 0.1% \- 0.4% of cadastral value 43 | Owner |
| Acquisition Tax (ISAI) | One-time tax on property purchase | \~5% of purchase price 43 | Buyer |
| Notary Fees | Fees for notary public services | 1% \- 2% of property value 43 | Buyer |
| Registration Fee | Fee for registering property with Public Registry | Varies 43 | Buyer |
| Appraisal Fee | Cost for professional property appraisal | $200 \- $500 USD 43 | Buyer |
| Legal Fees | Fees for legal services related to transaction | $500 \- $1,500 USD 43 | Buyer |

## **Conclusion: Key Considerations for Your Mexico City Property Venture**

Purchasing property in Mexico City as an American expat is a feasible endeavor, with the advantage of direct ownership. However, it is crucial to recognize and understand the legal and regulatory differences compared to the United States. Engaging with reputable professionals, including experienced real estate agents, qualified Mexican attorneys specializing in real estate, and a trusted Notario Público, is highly recommended to navigate the process effectively. Thorough due diligence on any property you consider is essential to ensure clear title and avoid potential legal complications. If you are considering renovating the property or operating it as an Airbnb rental, be sure to research and comply with all local regulations and obtain the necessary permits and licenses. By carefully planning and seeking expert guidance, your journey to owning property in the vibrant city of Mexico City can be a successful and rewarding experience.
